# Tech

- React.js 18.2.0
- Redux 4.2.0
- Redux-Saga 1.1.3
- React testing library

I used Redux as state management and Redux-Saga for middleware. So, Personally in small apps like that i prefer to use 
React Context to manage our state in one place and make reachable from all components. But now o wanted to use Redux and Redux saga to show that they are really good couple and make code more clear, readable as well as make our life easy
when we have lots of state.


## Environment

- Node 16.13.0
- NPM 8.11.0

##### Design

I inspired from mockup that you had added in the task and kept it simple
